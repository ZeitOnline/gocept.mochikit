gocept.mochikit
===============

gocept.mochikit integrates MochiKit (http://mochikit.com) into Zope 2 and
Zope 3. Send questions to Christian Zagrodnick <cz@gocept.com>.


Usage (Zope 3)
==============

To use gocept.mochikit you need to add the following to your package
configuration (ZCML):: 

    <include package="gocept.mochikit" />

This provides several resource libraries using the `zc.resourcelibrary`
package. In a page template you use::

    <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit" />

This will automatically load the main MochiKit file in its packed variant.
There are several additional MochiKit files which are not included in the
libarary above:

  * mochikit.DragAndDrop
  * mochikit.Controls
  * mochikit.MockDOM
  * mochikit.Selector
  * mochikit.Test

You use those like this::

    <tal:replace replace="resource_library:mochikit.DragAndDrop" />

Unpacked Variant
----------------

If you need to debug it's often easier to use the plain and unpacked MochiKit
variant. To use you load the package like this::

    <include package="gocept.mochikit" file="unpacked" />


Usage (Zope 2)
==============

To use gocept.mochikit in Zope 2 you need to add the following to your package
configuration (ZCML)::

    <include package="gocept.mochikit" file="zope2.zcml" />

This provides the packed version of MochiKit, so in your HTML template you
need to include the following::

    <script
      type="text/javascript"
      src="++resource++gocept.mochikit/MochiKit.js">
    </script>
